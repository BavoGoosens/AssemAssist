AssemAssist
===========

This system acts as an assembly line assistment system for a vehicle manufacturing company. There are several assembly lines with custom work posts at which work can be performed. A garage holder or custom shop manager is able to place certain orders for vehicles or tasks. A manager can control the assembly process. Vehicle mechanics can perform tasks at the assembly line which will automaticly advance itself when all tasks are completed and the state allows the line to move forward.

If you supply parameters to the program (ex. java -jar system.jar "parameter stuffff") the system will start without any initial data. 
When the program is run without parameters some initial data will be loaded to show how one day gets scheduled and completed.
